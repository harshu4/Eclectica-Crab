# Inspiration ✨

Current metaverse platforms have following limitation:
- Entry-Barrier:

    - Entry cost is prohibitively expensive in current metaverse platforms.Even for hosting events you have to rent or buy land.
- Invite-Only Events:

    - Current metaverses do not allow users to host invite-only events as a result use-cases of metaverse drop significantly.
Fast On Chain Payment:

We used Crab Network to accomplish this.
